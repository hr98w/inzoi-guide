# Needs/Motives

The Needs System forms the core survival mechanic in inZOI, featuring eight essential requirements that every Zoi must maintain for optimal well-being. 

These fundamental needs directly impact a Zoi's ability to function and thrive within the game world, creating a dynamic balance between basic survival and higher-level aspirations. When these needs are properly managed, Zois can effectively pursue their ambitions and life goals; conversely, neglecting them can lead to serious consequences, including deteriorating health and potential death.

Each of the eight distinct needs requires specific attention and care, ranging from basic physiological requirements like hunger and sleep to more complex social and emotional needs. Players must develop effective strategies to address these needs while simultaneously managing their Zoi's career progression, relationships, and personal development. This intricate balance between immediate needs and long-term goals creates a rich, challenging gameplay experience that mirrors the complexities of real-life decision-making.
