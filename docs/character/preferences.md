# Preferences

The Preference System in inZOI represents a sophisticated personality customization feature that allows players to define their Zois' individual tastes and aversions. 

With the ability to select up to 10 distinct preferences per character, this system creates unique behavioral patterns and emotional responses that significantly impact gameplay dynamics and character development.

These customizable preferences are deeply integrated with the Zoi's trait system and can be modified through the Zoi card interface at any time. Each preference choice influences daily activities, social interactions, and emotional responses, creating a more immersive and personalized life simulation experience. The system's flexibility enables players to continuously evolve their Zois' personalities, ensuring each character maintains a distinctive and authentic presence in the game world.
