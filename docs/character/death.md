# Death

Death in inZOI represents the final and irreversible state where a Zoi or other living entity permanently ceases to exist within the game world. 

This life-ending event can occur through various means, including natural aging, unexpected accidents, player negligence, or intentional actions taken by the player. While the game primarily features realistic causes of death, it also incorporates some fictional elements to enhance gameplay variety.

The impact of death in inZOI extends beyond the immediate loss of the character. When a Zoi passes away, it creates rippling effects throughout the game's ecosystem, influencing remaining characters' emotional states, disrupting established relationships, and potentially altering the course of ongoing storylines. This permanent consequence system adds depth to the life simulation experience and encourages players to carefully consider their actions and responsibilities as caretakers.

- **Environmental Safety**: Minimize exposure to polluted areas and maintain a clean living environment. Consider relocating if the pollution levels become hazardous.

- **Health Maintenance**: Address medical issues promptly and maintain good hygiene practices. Regular health check-ups can prevent diseases from becoming fatal.
