# Values

Values represent the fundamental belief system that governs how Zois interact, make decisions, and navigate their virtual lives within inZOI. These core principles serve as the foundation for each character's unique personality and social behavior patterns, creating authentic and meaningful gameplay experiences.

Throughout their journey in inZOI, a Zoi's value system dynamically evolves based on their life experiences and significant events. These personal values play a crucial role in shaping everything from daily routines to major life decisions, influencing career choices, relationship dynamics, and lifestyle preferences. The depth of this value system ensures that each Zoi develops into a distinct individual with their own aspirations, moral compass, and life goals.
