# Life Stage/Age Stage

The Age Stage System in inZOI introduces a revolutionary approach to character aging, where Zois progress through distinct developmental phases rather than experiencing continuous aging. 

Each life stage transition in inZOI represents a pivotal moment in a Zoi's development, with real-time durations carefully balanced to create an immersive life simulation experience. From the fleeting Newborn phase lasting 96 minutes to the extended Senior stage spanning 3360 minutes, these precisely timed periods ensure that players can fully explore and appreciate each developmental milestone. This innovative approach to character progression creates a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience that captures the essence of life's natural evolution while maintaining player engagement throughout each stage.
