## Features Coming by Early Access  

We’ve prioritized several updates to make the cooking experience more immersive and enjoyable. Here’s what you can expect by Early Access:  

- **No more refrigerator expenses:** Gathering cooking ingredients will no longer cost you money, making ingredient collection more accessible.  
- **External ingredient sourcing:** All ingredients can now be obtained through external means, such as purchases or gathering in the environment.  
- **Food delivery option:** Players will be able to order food deliveries for convenience and variety.  
- **Unique food effects:** Eating certain foods will have different effects on your Zois (e.g., a “food coma” effect for particularly heavy meals).  
- **Enhanced cooking animations:** We’ve improved the quality of cooking animations for a smoother and more satisfying visual experience.

## Post-Early Access Plans  

After Early Access, we have even more exciting features lined up. Here’s a sneak peek:  

- **Cooking-related jobs:** Freelance and other positions related to cooking will allow players to expand their career opportunities.  
- **Zoi-specific eating patterns:** Introduce unique eating habits, such as preferences for specific ingredients or special eating cycles like intermittent fasting.  
- **Ingredient gardening:** Players will have the option to grow their own ingredients through gardening, adding a fresh layer of depth to the cooking system.  
- **New group activity – Cooking Together:** Bring friends into the mix with a new cooperative activity where you can cook together and bond over meals.
